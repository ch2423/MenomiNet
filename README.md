Op-Ed

There is a real need for the community of Menomonie to learn what is happening with the health of nearby waterways. Water health is the tip of the iceberg leading to knowledge about plant and animal health in the area, and of course, humans health. The main barriers to water monitoring in Lake Menomin, especially in the 30 years since it has become eutrophic, seem to be cost, coordination, and transparency.
