Op-Ed

There is a real need for the community of Menomonie to learn what is happening with lake health in nearby waterways. Lake health is the tip of the iceberg, leading to knowledge about the health of vital plants and animals in the area, and of course, humans. The main barriers to monitoring lake health in Menomin, especially in the 30 years since it has become eutrophic, seem to be cost, coordination, and transparency.
